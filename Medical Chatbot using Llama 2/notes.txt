1 importing GGML model from haggingface, then load it from C-transformers
2 - sentences transformers to embeddings
3 - vector store

1- ctransformers is library usefull to run llm model on cpu or ggml format
2- SentenceTransformers : is pre-trained on large datasets used by models like bert
    allowing them to generate embeddings that better capture the meaning of a sentence or short text, rather than individual word embeddings.
3- A vector store is a specialized database designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors.
 In natural language processing and machine learning,
 vector stores are crucial for handling embeddings,
 which are numerical representations of text,
 images, or other data types. Vector stores enable efficient similarity search,
 clustering, and other operations on embeddings, 
making them foundational in applications that use large language models,
 semantic search, and recommendation systems.
